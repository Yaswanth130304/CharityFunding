# CharityFunding

- Blockchain can increase transparency: By using a decentralized ledger system, donors can see exactly where their funds are being used. This can help to increase trust   in the charitable sector and reduce concerns about fraud or mismanagement.

- Blockchain can increase security: The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it difficult for any one entity to control or manipulate the system. This can help to     ensure that funds are distributed fairly and equitably, and that they are used for the intended purposes.

- Blockchain can reduce costs: By reducing the need for intermediaries in the charity funding process, blockchain can help to reduce overhead costs and ensure that more   money goes directly to the charitable cause.

- Blockchain can increase accountability: The transparency and security provided by blockchain can help to increase accountability in the charity funding process. This     can help to ensure that charities are using funds in an ethical and responsible way.

- There is a need for greater transparency and accountability in the charitable sector: Many people are concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability in     the charitable sector. By using blockchain to decentralize charity funding, it may be possible to address these concerns and increase trust in the sector.

- There is still things that needs to be done like withdrawing money, logout and transaction page.

- By this project we can almost eliminate the fake charities since it is very hard to tamper with blockchain and at the same time we can donate the charities without any fear(like our money might not be used for intended cause).

- In this we intended to update a feature where once a donor donated some money to the charity he/sh will get emails notifying how the charity is using their money and what all they are purchasing with it.
